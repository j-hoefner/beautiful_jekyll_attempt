## i.\_h.o.w.

\[Verse 01\]  
Two winters ago  
I found this outpost  
     hidden from most sights  
While exploring the wild  
the meadow opened up to me  
     in a valley long sought  
Duty and the task  
have never let me come again  
     they were gaining strength  
up in the Hills  
it waits for me  
     and now it's time  

\[Chorus\]  
I'm out for the Hills  
my whereabouts uncertain  
no farewells preceded this escape  
yet a welcome surely awaits  
  
A vehicle head over wheels  
the dreamer left the town  
he outstripped all his obstacles  
heading for checkpoint outpost  
 
\[Verse 02\]  
Just the keys, some books  
and of course my Lute  
     will be all I need  
I won't need more  
wherever I go  
     Horizon closing in  
as trees fly past  
and mountains dance  
     I slowly realise  

the engine roar my breath  
every turn a heartbeat  
     my limbs are eating asphalt  
symbiosis  

\[Chorus\]  

\[C part\]  
This is us breaking out  
lest we break down  
up the winding path  
out of the golden cage  

Everyone, we're ready  
you'd better have your lobelies up to temperature by now  
and  
be wary of the precipice  

\[Chorus\]  

\[Outro\]  
Looming in the distance  
the outpost  
I am finally back
